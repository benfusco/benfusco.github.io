                <h2>Ben Fusco</h2>

                <p>Ben Fusco is a designer passionate about architecture, fabrication, and the natural world. With a Bachelor of Architecture from Ball State University, my skills include parametric design, digital modeling, digital fabrication, and woodworking. My work explores the intersection of emerging digital technologies and traditional craft to create thoughtful, well communicated design solutions.</p>
                <p> My approach to design is informed by a deep appreciation for storytelling, environmental responsibility, and social impact and manifests in open-source furniture projects, digital art, and more. I have received recognition for my work, including an Honorable Mention in ICON's Initiative 99 global architecture competition. Beyond design, my experiences as a tour guide and outdoor enthusiast have strengthened my ability to communicate complex ideas, lead diverse groups, and adapt to ever-changing conditions—skills that also inform my design philosophy.</p>
                <p>This website,  built by me (with a bit of help from AI), is intended to include resources that I use  in my daily life as well as projects and information I am currently researching. All source files for the website are available on my GitHub.</p>
                <p>Thank you for visiting, and enjoy!</p>
