                <h2>Ben Fusco</h2>

                <p>Ben Fusco is a designer passionate about architecture, fabrication, and the natural world. With a Bachelor of Architecture from Ball State University, his skills include parametric design, digital modeling, digital fabrication, and woodworking. HIs work explores the intersection of emerging digital technologies and traditional craft to create thoughtful, well communicated design solutions.</p>
                <p>Ben's approach to design is informed by a deep appreciation for storytelling, environmental responsibility, and social impact and manifests in open-source furniture projects, digital art, and more. He has received recognition for his work, including an Honorable Mention in ICON's Initiative 99 global architecture competition. Beyond design, Ben's experiences as a tour guide and outdoor enthusiast have strengthened his ability to communicate complex ideas, lead diverse groups, and adapt to ever-changing conditions—skills that also inform his design philosophy.</p>
                <p>This website,  built by Ben (with a bit of help from AI), is intended to include resources that he use  in my daily life as well as projects and research that are currently in progress. All source files for the website are available on GitHub.</p>
                <p>Thank you for visiting, and enjoy!</p>
